name: Slack data loss prevention rule modified
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a Slack DLP rule is disabled or a DLP violation is deleted.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Slack audit logs for the disabling of a Slack DLP rule or the deletion of a DLP violation. Slack DLP scans messages and files for content that violates custom rules created by your organization.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the change made by the user is authorized.
  2. If the change was unauthorized or unexpected, initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate.
