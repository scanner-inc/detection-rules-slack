name: Slack data export download
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect when a Slack export, such as a channel or user export, is downloaded.

  ## Strategy

  This rule monitors Slack events for downloaded exports, which can include significant data like conversations, files, and user information. Unauthorized exports may indicate a potential data breach, insider threat, or misuse of admin privileges.

  Potential risks include:

  - Unauthorized access to sensitive company data.
  - Insider threats sharing confidential information.
  - Exposure of private conversations and user details to unauthorized parties.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Verify if the export download is expected by:
     - Contacting the user or admin who initiated the export to confirm the legitimacy of the request.
     - Reviewing the type of data exported and the business justification for the action.
     - Checking Slack logs for other unusual activities by the user, such as mass downloads or privilege escalation.

  2. If the export is unauthorized or unexpected:
     - Initiate the organization's incident response process and investigate.
     - Analyze the exported data for sensitive information and determine the scope of exposure.
     - Monitor for any further attempts to export data or download sensitive information.
