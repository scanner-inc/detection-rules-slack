name: Slack user role elevated to administrative privileges
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a Slack user's role is changed to an administrator or owner.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Slack audit logs for changes in user roles, specifically when a role is elevated to administrator or owner. These roles grant additional privileges for managing accounts and settings in Slack.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the role change by the user is authorized.
  2. If the change is unauthorized or unexpected, initiate your organization's incident response process and conduct an investigation.
