name: Slack private channel converted to public
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect when a Slack channel is changed from private to public.

  ## Strategy

  This rule monitors Slack events for changes in a channel's privacy setting from private to public. Making a private channel public can expose sensitive conversations and information. Tracking this change is crucial as it may be deliberate, accidental, or malicious.

  Potential risks associated with this change include:

  - Exposure of sensitive information to a wider audience.
  - Unintended sharing of critical discussions.
  - Increased risk of data leaks if the channel contains sensitive information.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Determine if the channel change is expected by:

     - Contacting the channel owner or administrators to confirm whether they authorized the change.
     - Reviewing Slack logs related to the user who performed the change, focusing on:
       - The time of the change and surrounding activities.
       - Unusual behavior or other changes, such as role modifications or new members added to the channel.
     - Checking the content of the channel to assess whether it contains sensitive information that should not be public.

  2. If the activity is unauthorized or malicious:

     - Begin the organization's incident response process to investigate further.
     - Immediately revert the channel back to private if it contains sensitive data.
     - Review access permissions to ensure only trusted users can modify channel privacy settings.
     - Investigate if any unauthorized users accessed the channel while it was public and evaluate potential exposure.
