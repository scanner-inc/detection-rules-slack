name: Slack two factor authentication requirement changed
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect changes to Slack's two-factor authentication requirement.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Slack audit logs for modifications to the two-factor requirement, which could indicate attempts by attackers to alter authentication processes for unauthorized access.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Determine if the change made by the user email is authorized.
  2. If the change was unauthorized or unexpected, initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate.
