name: Slack SSO setting changed
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect changes to Single Sign On (SSO) restrictions.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Slack audit logs for changes to SSO restrictions, as attackers may modify authentication processes to access user credentials or gain unauthorized access to accounts.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the change made by the user is authorized.
  2. If the change was unauthorized or unexpected, initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate.
