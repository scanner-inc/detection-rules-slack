  ## Goal

  Detect when a Slack audit anomaly event is raised.

  ## Strategy

  This rule monitors Slack audit logs for anomalies, which indicate unexpected user behaviors. Each anomalous event will have a reason code. Examples of anomalies include:

  - Excessive file downloads
  - Use of a Tor exit node
  - Unusual behavior from an administrator account

  ## Triage and response

  1. Determine if the behavior is expected by:
     - Contacting the user for more information
     - Checking for other signals and logs generated by the impacted user, and looking for deviations in geolocation, ASN, or device properties
  2. If the activity is deemed malicious:
     - Initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate.
