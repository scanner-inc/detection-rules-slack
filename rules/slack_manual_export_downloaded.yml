name: Slack manual export downloaded
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a Slack manual export has been downloaded.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Slack audit logs for manual export downloads, which include messages and links to files from public channels, private channels, and direct messages.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Determine if the change taken by the user email is authorized.
  2. If the change was not authorized or was unexpected, begin your organization's incident response process and investigate.
